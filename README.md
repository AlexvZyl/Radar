# Radar

The repository used in my Master's degree. It mostly handles radar processing, some new techniques used (see [Publications](https://github.com/Alex-vZyl/Publications)) and classification of data.

Some of the code is a mess, since it was written with a "please work ASAP" mentality. It is not my best work in terms of programming, but it most definitely has some interesting radar stuff going on. If this repo turns out to be used by someone else I will make sure the actual programming is better.
