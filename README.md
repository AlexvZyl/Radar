# ðŸ“¡ Radar

Techniques and algorithms implemented during my Master's thesis.

Some of the code is a mess, since it was written with a "please work ASAP" mentality. It is not my best work in terms of programming, but it most definitely has some interesting radar stuff going on. If this repo turns out to be used by someone else I will make sure the actual programming is better.
